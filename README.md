# Crowdfunding-Data-frames

Summary:
IN ETL_Mini_Project I extracted data from crowdfunding.xlsx and organized it using Jupyter Notebook into two smaller csvs named category.csv and subcategory.csv. 

Then I created a larger dataframe from crowdfunding.xlsx changing data types, renaming colums and cleaning the information so it could more easliy be added to the SQL database. This new csv was named Campaign.csv.

I created one last CSV to store all contact info from contacts.xlsx giving each row an id. This was then exported as contacts.csv.

After all the new CSVs were created they were uploaded to a sql database linking the related tables.
