# Crowdfunding-Data-frames

Summary:
IN ETL_Mini_Project I extracted data from crowdfunding.xlsx and organized it using Jupyter Notebook into two smaller csvs named category and subcategory to later be added to a SQL database.

Then I created a larger dataframe from crowdfunding.xlsx that would allow it to be later uploaded to a SQL database. Changing data types and organizing columns was required. 

After that a SQL schema was created to store the cleaned data
